# code3Dfinal
The final code hand-in for my Honours 2020 thesis. :student:

The web app allows users to code 3D models in Javascript and visualise the 3D printing of the model.

The modeling page was created by **Maria**, my project partner and, <br>
the printing simulation page was created by **me**. <br>


### To run: <br>
**IF using Linux**, run <br>
sudo apt-get install slic3r <br>

**For all OS**, run <br>
npm install <br>
npm run start <br>
browse localhost:8000 <br>


Technologies that I used: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Three.js for the visualization. :artist:</li> 
  <li>Slic3r for slicing the 3D model sent from the front end. :printer:</li>
</ul>
